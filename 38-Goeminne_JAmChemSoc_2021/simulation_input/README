---------------------------------

usage:

 - python md.py $TEMPERATURE $PRESSURE $VOL_CONSTRAINT
    - Used for generating input structures of the empty framework at a range of volumes. For this, vol_constraint = False
        (by applying large positive or negative mechanical pressures)
    - Used to extract the P(V) profile, from which F(V) is determined. For this, vol_constraint = True


 - python mcmd.py $TEMPERATURE $PRESSURE
    - Used to perform a hybrid MC simulation with constraint volume.
